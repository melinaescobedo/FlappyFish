    Flappy Bird Remake

    Author: Colton Ogden

    What is Flappy According to the author? (Context)
    A mobile game by Dong Nguyen that went viral in 2013, utilizing a very simple 
    but effective gameplay mechanic of avoiding pipes indefinitely by just tapping 
    the screen, making the player's bird avatar flap its wings and move upwards slightly. 
    A variant of popular games like "Helicopter Game" that floated around the internet
    for years prior. Illustrates some of the most basic procedural generation of game
    levels possible as by having pipes stick out of the ground by varying amounts, acting
    as an infinitely generated obstacle course for the player.

-- our game as code, rather than keeping track of many disparate variables and

require 'states/ScoreState' -- Class that show the final score after you lost. And can change from score state to countdown state.
